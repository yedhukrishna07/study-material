    <h4>What is React, and why is it popular for building user interfaces?</h4>
     <p>React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It is popular because it allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React's component-based architecture, virtual DOM for performance optimization, and strong community support contribute to its widespread adoption.</p>

            </h4>
         <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It is popular because it enables efficient, dynamic updates with its virtual DOM, promotes reusable components, and has strong community support and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.

        <h4>How do you manage state in a React application?
            </h4>
        <p>In a React application, state is managed using the useState hook for local component state and the useReducer hook for more complex state logic. For global state management, tools like Context API, Redux, or third-party libraries like MobX are commonly used.</p>

        <h4>What are props in React, and how are they different from state?
            </h4>
        <p>
            Props in React are inputs passed to components from their parent, allowing data and event handlers to be shared. They are immutable within the component. State, on the other hand, is mutable data managed within the component itself and can change over time, triggering re-renders.</p>

        <h4>What are hooks in React, and how do you use them?
            short answer for interview</h4>
        <p>
            Hooks in React are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState for state management, useEffect for side effects, and useContext for accessing context. Hooks are used by calling them at the top level of your functional components.

        <h4>How do you handle forms and input fields in React?
        </h4>
        <p>
            In React, forms and input fields are handled by maintaining state for the input values using the useState hook. You create controlled components by setting the input's value attribute to the state and updating the state with an onChange handler. This ensures that the React state is the single source of truth for the form data.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>What is the Virtual DOM, and how does React use it?
            </h4>
        <p>
            The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM in React. React uses it to efficiently update the user interface by first applying changes to the Virtual DOM, then comparing it to the previous version, and finally applying only the necessary changes to the real DOM, which improves performance.</p>

        <h4>How do you handle side effects in a React application using hooks like useEffect?</h4>
        <p>In React, side effects are handled using the useEffect hook. You pass a function to useEffect that contains the side effect logic, and it runs after the component renders. You can also provide a dependency array to control when the effect runs, such as after specific state or prop changes</p>

        <h4>How do you implement routing in a React application?</h4>
        <p>Routing in a React application is implemented using a library like React Router. You wrap your app with BrowserRouter and define routes using the Route component. You can create navigation links with the Link component, enabling navigation between different parts of your application without reloading the page.</p>

        <h4>What is global state in a React application?</h4>
        <p>
            Global state in a React application refers to the state that is shared across multiple components, rather than being confined to a single component. It is used to manage data that needs to be accessible by various parts of the application, such as user information or application settings. Global state can be managed using tools like Context API, Redux, or other state management libraries</p>
