   <h4>
    1.What is Express.js, and why is it used in the MERN stack?
   </h4>
   <p>
    <li>
        Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs in JavaScript by providing a minimalist yet powerful set of features.
    </li>
    <li>
        Express.js is integral to the MERN stack because it facilitates backend development in Node.js. It offers a streamlined way to handle routing, middleware integration, and HTTP requests, making it easier to build scalable and efficient web applications. Its simplicity and compatibility with Node.js align perfectly with the goals of the MERN stack, enabling developers to create robust full-stack applications using JavaScript across the entire stack.

        <h4>
            How do you set up a basic Express.js server?
        </h4>
        <p>
            To set up a basic Express.js server, you initialize a Node.js project, install Express as a dependency, create a server.js file with Express configuration (defining routes and handling requests), and then start the server using Node.js. Express simplifies building web servers and APIs in Node.js by providing a minimalist framework with robust features for routing and middleware integration.
        </p>

        <h4>How do you handle routing in an Express.js application?</h4>
         <p>In Express.js, routing is handled using methods like app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete, etc., to define routes based on HTTP methods. Each route can have a callback function that processes requests and sends responses. This allows developers to organize application logic and handle different client requests efficiently.

    <div>
        <h4>What are middleware functions in Express.js, and how do you use them?</h4>
         <p>
            <li>Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects in an application's request-response cycle. They can modify these objects, execute code, and end the request-response cycle by sending a response or passing control to the next middleware function.</li>
            <li>Middleware functions are used in Express.js by using the app.use() method to mount them in the application's middleware stack. They can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, handling errors, and more, making them essential for extending the functionality of Express applications.</li>
         </p>
    </div>
     <hr>
    <div>
        <h4>How do you handle errors in an Express.js application?</h4>
         <p>In Express.js, errors are handled using middleware functions with four parameters (err, req, res, next). These functions catch errors thrown in route handlers or other middleware. Custom error handling middleware can be defined to log errors, send appropriate error responses to clients, or handle errors in specific ways based on application requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <h4>How do you implement authentication and authorization in Express.js?</h4>
    
         <p>In Express.js, authentication and authorization are typically implemented using middleware functions and libraries like Passport.js. Authentication verifies user identities, often using strategies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth, while authorization controls access to resources based on user roles or permissions. Middleware intercepts requests to validate credentials, manage sessions, and enforce access rules, ensuring secure and controlled access to protected routes and resources.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Can you explain the purpose of req and res objects in Express.js?</h4>
         <p>
            <li>req (request) object: Represents the HTTP request from the client, containing information such as headers, parameters, query strings, body data, and more.</li>
            <li>res (response) object: Represents the HTTP response that the server sends back to the client, allowing developers to send data, set headers, and manage the response status.</li>
            <li>Together, these objects facilitate communication between clients and servers in Express.js applications, enabling robust request handling and response generation.</li>
         </p>

    <div>
        <h4>How do you parse incoming request bodies in Express.js?
            short answer</h4>
         <p>In Express.js, you parse incoming request bodies using middleware functions like express.json() for JSON bodies and express.urlencoded() for URL-encoded bodies. These middleware functions automatically parse the request body and populate req.body with the parsed data, allowing you to access and process it within your route handlers.
         </p>

    <div>
        <h4>What are the benefits of using Express.js over other web frameworks?</h4>
         <p>
            <li>Minimalist and Flexible: Express.js provides a minimalistic framework that allows developers to structure their applications according to their needs, without imposing strict conventions.</li>
            <li>Robust Middleware Ecosystem: It has a rich ecosystem of middleware that simplifies tasks like routing, authentication, error handling, and more, enhancing developer productivity.</li>
            <li>Integration with Node.js: Being built on top of Node.js, Express.js leverages its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

            </li>
            <li>Large Community and Ecosystem: Express.js has a large and active community, with a wide range of plugins and modules available, providing solutions for various application requirements.</li>
            <li>Versatility: Express.js can be used to build different types of applications, from simple APIs to complex web applications, due to its flexibility and adaptability.</li>
